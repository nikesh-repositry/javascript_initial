================================================NUMBERS============================================
=> unlike many other languages js has only one number type:Number
=> which means no separate types for intergers or floats remember it
=> so in js numbers represent both integer and floating point values
=> numbers is technically  a constructor function(built in function) in js
=> numbers are a primitive data type

Characteristics:
>all numbers in js are stored as 64 bit floating point values as per IEEE 754 standard
>(approximately −9,007,199,254,740,991 to +9,007,199,254,740,991) range
>no distinction between integers and floats, all are floating point
>special values NaN(not a number), +infinity, -infinity

Number representation like decimal, hexadecimal, binary, octal, scientific notation

Types of numberic values:
1. interger = whole numbers like 10
2. floating point = decimal numbers like 10.5
3. infinity = larger than any other number like infinity, -infinity
4. NaN = result of invalid numeric opertions like 0/0, parseInt("abc")

There are two ways to use numbers:
1.Primitive type
  let num = 100; and like this for other number representation
2.Number object (constuctor type)
  syntax: new Number(value) here any value to convert to number (string, boolean, etc) default to 0.
  new Number() creats an object, not a primitive number.AND this can lead to confusing bugs and unexpected hehavior.
  let numobj = new Number(100);
Note::avoid new Number() for primitives; use literals for better performance.
