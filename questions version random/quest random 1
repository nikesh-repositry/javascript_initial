1. what is functional pipelines in js?
   a pipeline is a sequence of functions applied one after another. instead of nesting functions or writing
   imperative code you pass data through a series of pure functions.
   improves readability
   encourages modular and reusable code
   aligns with functional programming principle
   it can be work - manual chaining
                  - pipe() = left to right func chaining
                  - compose() = right to left func chaining
   real world use case - data tranformation
                       - middleware chaining
                       - RxJS streams
