1.What is a pure function, and why is it useful in UI rendering?
== a pure function in programming conducts deterministic behavior(always returns the same output/result for the given input) and no side effects(does not modify external variables, state or data structure outside its scope)
   it helps in ui rendering because
   predictability: pure components render the same output for the same props and state, making debugging and testing much easier.
   performance optimization: react can efficiently re render only the components that change 
   pure func are easier to reason about, refactor and reuse
   since pure func don not mutate external state they help prevent hard to track bugs caused by unintended side effects
