DEFINATION= in short FP is about using pure function and avoiding shared effect or side effects.
=shared state means multiple parts of the program are accessing or modiifying the same data like a common object or global variable
=side effects is anything a function does besides returing a value like changing the dom, logging to console, modifying a variable outside its scope, and more others.
=pure function is always returns the same output for the same input and causes no side effects.
=pure function are treated as first class citizen which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments and returned from other functions.
=FP focuses on what to do not how to do.
=FP follow immutability that is data does not change rather you create a new version of it
=FP treats functions as values that it can be passed around like numbers or strings

now there are separate concepts about FP to be learned about 
1.pure function
2.immutability
3.declarative
4.avoid shared state
5.avoid side effects
6.reuse of compose logic
7.don not iterate
8.loose coupling
9.first class  
10.higher order functions
11.composition of function
12.avoiding mutation with spread and rest
13.anonymous and arrow function
14.currying and partial function
15.recursion
16.closure
17.built in methods

1.pure function:::
=a funtion is called pure if it always gives the same output for the same input  
=it does not cause any side effects like changing external variables or the way a webpage looks.
=and impure function is that function which returns different output for the same input over time and or causes side effects

2.immutability:::
=in FP original data is read only and instead of editing you create fresh copies and for that js helps with const, spread operator and methods like map
=js can handle immutability by using const, object.freeze(), spread syntax for arrays and objects

3.declarative code:::
=this means that you just describe what should be done not how to get it done.

4.avoid shared state:::
=sharing mutable state means different parts of your programs can access and change the same piece of data
 this can lead to hard to find bugs in async and parallel systems

5.avoid side effects:::
=a side effect is anything that a function does beyond just returning a value.
=this could include api calls, dom manipulation etc

6.reuse or compose logic:::
=this refers to build small and focused functions that can be easily combined to create more complex operation
 like building small reusable  functions and composing them together.

7.do not iterate:::
=in FP its often preferred to avoid traditional loops like for , while etc instead use methods like map, filter, reduce which are more declarative.

8.loose coupling:::
=coupling refers to how much one part of the code dependent on another
=loose coupling means that functions and modules are as independent as possible and reducing reliance on each others

9.first class function:::
=in js functions ae first class citizens which means you can assign them to variables, pass them as arguments, return them from other function.

10. higher order function:::
=a higher order function is a function that does atleast one (takes another function as a argument) or (returns a function)

11.compostition of function:::
=composition combines small functions into bigger and the complex one.

12.avoiding mutations with spread and rest:::
=spread operator helps you copy arrays or objects and updates them without mutating the original
=rest operator collects the rest of the values when destructuring

13.anonymous and arrow function:::
=an anonymous function is a function without a name
=arrow functions are a shorted syntax for writing anonymous functions

14.currying and partial application:::
=currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each taking a single arguments
=partial application means fixing a few arguments of a function and returning a new function that takes the rest

15.recursion:::
=it means function calls itself to solve a smaller sub problem 

16.closure:::
=a closure is when a function remembers variables from its outer scope even after the outer function finishes

17.built in methods:::
=js arrays provide several functional methods that do not mutate the original array and these are heavily used in FP
a) map() = used to tranform each element in an array
b) filter() = used to filter out elements based on a condition
c) reduce() = used to combine all elements into a single value
d) forEach() = used to perform an action for each element (no pure often used for side effects)
e) find() = finds the first element that matches a condition
