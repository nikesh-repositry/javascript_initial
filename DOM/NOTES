                                                  =DEFINITON OF DOM=
the dom is a programming interface that lets javascript interact with and manipulate the content, structure and style of a web page.
actually when any browser loads a webpage, it turns the html into a tree like structure where each elements like <div>, <spin>,<form> etc becomes a node in that tree. and after that javascript can access element, change content, modify style, add and remove elements and other operation.



                                                    ====BASICS====
Document object is available inside
window object.
window object is the global object for the browser enviroment. 
window object represents the browser window or tab that displays you web page.
window object is like the master controller.
window object holds everything like the page, the script, time, alerts and more.
all global variables and functions become properties of window.
we can reach the document via window.document and it includes 
    [window.alert()] [window.setTimeout()] [window.location] [window.history] and more....

DOM represents the html document as tree    BOM represents the browser enviroment outside html document
DOM main object is document                 BOM main object is window
DOM manipulate page content/style           BOM control browser behavior 
DOM allow js to operate with html & css     BOM interact with the browser window, tabs & navigator

NODELIST is a collection of nodes(elements,texts,comments) extracted from a document
NODELIST is like array but not a array
NODELIST has two type live NODELIST and static NODELIST where in livenodelist it automatically updates the list whenever the DOM changes and in the staticnodelist it takes the snapshot of nodes at the time the query was made not updated with DOM changes.
LIVENODELIST eg element.childNodes and STATICNODELIST eg document.querySelectorAll()
SOMEWHERE LINE 28 TO LINE 44 the nodelist code with explanation for clearity
NODELIST can be convert into array



                                                  =SELECTION OF HTML=
the dom is a tree like structure that represents all elements of your HTML document and in js we can access, select and manipulate these elements using different seletion methods
1. getElementById()
2. getElementsByTagName()
3. getElementsByClassName()
4. querySelector()
5. querySelectorAll()
                                                   1.getElementById()
