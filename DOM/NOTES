                                                  =DEFINITON OF DOM=
the dom is a programming interface that lets javascript interact with and manipulate the content, structure and style of a web page.
actually when any browser loads a webpage, it turns the html into a tree like structure where each elements like <div>, <spin>,<form> etc becomes a node in that tree. and after that javascript can access element, change content, modify style, add and remove elements and other operation.
                                                    ====BASICS====
window object is the global object for the browser enviroment. 
window object represents the browser window or tab that displays you web page.
window object is like the master controller.
window object holds everything like the page, the script, time, alerts and more.
all global variables and functions become properties of window.

    [window.alert()] [window.setTimeout()] [window.location] [window.history] and more....
