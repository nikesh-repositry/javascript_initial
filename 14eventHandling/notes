                                 ========SO THIS IS THE NOTE FOR EVENTS CONCEPTS========
                                       +++++++++++++EVENT HANDLING+++++++++++++
Definition:: an event in js is anything that happens in the browser that your code can respond to for eg. clicking a button, typing on the keyboard, scrolling the page, submitting the form and many more others.
event handling is a fundamental concept in js particulary in web dev where it allows scipts to respond to user interactions or browser triggered occurrences.
event handling involves : detecting an event
                        : attaching a handler
                        : processing the event
event handling types : mouse events : click
                                    : dblclick
                                    : contextmenu and many more
                     : keyboard events : keydown
                                       : keypress
                                       : keyup
                     : form events : submit
                                   : focus
                                   : blur
how to handle events??
there are three ways 
1. inline html handlers
2. dom property handlers
3. addEventListener()
                                                  1. inline html handlers
=here you write javascipt directly inside the html tag
=it is very simple and quick
=good for small, one time events
=it is a bad practice in large project because it mix html and js
=it is hard to maintain for big application
=cant easily attach multiple handlers to the same events
=secuity risks in dynamic html
=potential of global scare pollution 
                                                  2. dom property handlers
=the dom property handler involves assigning a function directly to an element event property via js.
=here you selectt the element using the dom api like getelementbyid and set the property like onclick
=only one handler per event type per element (assigning a new one overwrites the old)
=keeps js separate from html and easy to understand
                                                  3. addEventListerner() 
=this method is modern, recommended approach for attaching event handlers.
=it's part of the dom level 2 events api and allow flexible, non overwritten attachments
=supports multiple handlers without overwriting to the same element
=event delegation friendly
=it is standard and cross browser
=can remove listeners using removeEventListener()
